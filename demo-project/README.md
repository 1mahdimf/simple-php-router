# Simple PHP router demo project

This project is here to give you a basic understanding of how to setup and using simple-php-router.

Please note that this demo-project only covers how to integrate simple-php-project in a project without a framework. If you are using some sort of PHP framework in your project 
the implementation might vary.

**What we won't cover:**

- How to setup a solution that fits your need. This is a basic demo to help you get started.
- How to add Controllers, Middlewares or ExceptionHandlers with cool functionality.
- How to integrate into third party frameworks.

**What we cover:**

- How to get up and running fast - from scratch.
- How to set ExceptionHandlers, Middlewares and Controllers working.
- How to setup your webservers.

## Installation

- Navigate to the `demo-project` folder and run `composer install`.
- Point your webserver to `demo-project/public`.

### Setting up Nginx

If you are using Nginx remember to enable url-rewriting.

You can easily do this by adding the following configuration for the Nginx configuration for the demo-project.

```
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
```

### Setting up Apache

Nothing special is required for Apache to work. We've include the `.htaccess` file in the `public` folder. If rewriting is not working for you, please 
check that `.htaccess` support is enabled in the Apache configuration - or add the rules manually.

## Folder structure

| Folder        | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| app            |Contains projects-specific PHP classes|
| public         |Public folder which are accessible through the web.|

## Notes

The demo project has it's own `Router` class implemented which extends the `SimpleRouter` class with further functionality such as 
default exceptionhandlers and middlewares. This class can be useful adding functionality that are required before and after routing 
occurs or add extra functionality to the router. 

In this project we also use our custom router-class to autoload the `routes.php` file.

Please check the `routes.php` file in `demo-project/app` for all the urls/rules in the project.

### CSRF-verifier

We've added a custom CSRF-verifier middleware called `CsrfVerifier` and disabled CSRF checks for all calls to `/api/*`.

### Exception handlers

The included `CustomExceptionHandler` class returns a json response for errors received on calls to `/api/*` or otherwise just forms a simple formatted error response.

### Middlewares

`ApiVerification` class is added to all calls to `/api/*`. This simple class just adds some data to the `Request` object, which is returned in one of the methods in the 
`ApiController` class.

### Urls

Please see `routes.php` for all routes and rules.

| URL        |
| ------------- |
| /             |
| /api/demo       |
| /companies       |
| /companies/[id]  |
| /contact         |
